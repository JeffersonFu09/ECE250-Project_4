# ECE250-Project_4

Implemented a graph data structure to store a weight, undirected graph. 
The graph was built using an adjacency list.
The graph supports:
- Loading a base graph from input file
- Inserting new edges
- Deleting vertices
- Finding the Minimum Spanning Tree and it's cost using Prim's
